### 🚀 What I do

- ⚙️ **MLOps Engineer** – Automating ML workflows and deployment pipelines to help teams move faster and more reliably.
- 🧠 **AI Enthusiast** – Passionate about using Machine Learning to streamline processes and support meaningful causes like **environmental sustainability**.
- 🐍 **Python Developer** – I care deeply about clean code, well-structured repos, and modern tools.

### ❤️ Things I enjoy

- 📐 Physics & Mathematics — my first loves and never too far from my mind.
- 🤖 Machine Learning — from modeling to deployment.
- 🛠️ Developer tools — Big fan of the modern Python ecosystem, especially:
  - [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) ⚡ for blazing-fast package management
  - [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) 🧹 for keeping code clean and consistent

### 🌱 Always curious

I'm always exploring new ways to improve ML systems, contribute to open-source, and apply AI for good.

Let’s build something cool together! 🚀
